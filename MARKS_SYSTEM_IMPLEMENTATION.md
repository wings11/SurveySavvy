# Marks Premium Currency System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive premium currency system called "Marks" alongside the existing points system. This creates a dual economy where users can boost surveys for priority placement and earn premium rewards.

## System Architecture

### Database Schema
- **marks column** in `users` table: Tracks user's marks balance (max 5000)
- **boost_marks column** in `surveys` table: Amount of marks spent to boost survey
- **mark_transactions table**: Complete audit trail of all marks transactions
- Proper indexes for performance on user_id, survey_id, and transaction_type

### Core Constants (lib/marks.ts)
- **USER_MAX**: 5000 marks per user limit
- **SURVEY_MAX**: 3000 marks per survey boost limit  
- **COMMISSION_RATE**: 4% platform commission
- **WLD_TO_MARKS_RATE**: 100 marks per 1 WLD (configurable exchange rate)

### API Enhancements

#### Users API (/api/users/me)
- Returns `totalMarks` alongside `totalPoints`
- Consistent with existing points calculation from dedicated tables

#### Surveys API (/api/surveys)
- **POST**: Validates marks balance, deducts boost cost, creates boost transaction
- **GET**: Returns surveys sorted by boost priority (boosted surveys first)
- Includes `boost_marks` in survey objects for UI display

#### Verification API (/api/surveys/[id]/verify)
- **Dual Rewards**: Awards both points (system-controlled) AND marks (user-boosted)
- Calculates marks per helper using commission formula: `(boost_marks - 4%) / goal_count`
- Records separate transactions for helper rewards and platform commission
- Maintains existing points system unchanged

## User Experience Features

### Survey Creation
- **Boost Input**: Optional marks boost field (0-3000 marks)
- **Real-time Preview**: Shows both points and marks rewards per helper
- **Validation**: Prevents exceeding user balance or survey limits
- **Visual Indicators**: Distinguishes boosted vs regular surveys

### Survey Feed
- **Priority Sorting**: Boosted surveys appear first
- **Boost Badges**: Visual "✨ Boosted" indicators 
- **Dual Rewards Display**: Shows both points and marks earnings
- **Enhanced Styling**: Gradient backgrounds for boosted surveys

### User Profile
- **Dual Currency Display**: Points and marks side-by-side
- **Responsive Grid**: Maintains clean layout on mobile/desktop

### Marks Manager
- **WLD Exchange**: Interface for purchasing marks with World Coin
- **Exchange Rate Display**: Current rates and system limits
- **Usage Guidance**: Clear explanation of boost mechanics
- **Commission Transparency**: Shows 4% platform fee

## Commission & Economics

### Revenue Model
- **4% Commission** on all marks transactions
- Platform earns from boost spending while helpers get majority reward
- Sustainable model that incentivizes quality survey creation

### Boost Mechanics
- **Priority Algorithm**: Boosted surveys appear at top of feed
- **Fair Distribution**: Marks divided equally among all helpers after commission
- **Minimum Guaranteed**: 1-point minimum from existing points system preserved

### User Limits
- **Balance Limit**: 5000 marks maximum per user (prevents hoarding)
- **Boost Limit**: 3000 marks maximum per survey (ensures reasonable costs)
- **Daily Validation**: Prevents abuse while allowing legitimate usage

## Integration Points

### World ID Verification
- Unchanged verification flow using MiniKit SDK
- Enhanced with dual rewards for boosted surveys
- Maintains all existing security and fraud prevention

### MiniApp Ecosystem
- Ready for World App payment integration
- Compatible with existing World ID infrastructure
- Leverages World Coin for marks purchasing

### Database Consistency
- **ACID Transactions**: All marks operations are atomic
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history for accountability
- **Performance Optimized**: Proper indexing for production scale

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
- **CreateSurvey**: Enhanced with boost functionality
- **SurveyFeed**: Priority sorting and visual indicators
- **UserProfile**: Dual currency display
- **MarksManager**: Purchase and exchange interface

### Backend Services
- **Marks Utilities**: Validation, calculation, and limit enforcement
- **Transaction Management**: Atomic operations with rollback support
- **Commission Handling**: Automated fee calculation and recording

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Marks failures don't break points system
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages for limit violations
- **System Resilience**: Continues operation if marks service issues

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- **Marks Limits**: Server-side enforcement of all limits
- **Balance Checks**: Prevents spending more than owned
- **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries throughout

### Transaction Integrity
- **Atomic Operations**: All marks operations are transactional
- **Rollback Support**: Failed operations don't leave inconsistent state
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail for investigation

### Fraud Prevention
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents rapid-fire transactions
- **Balance Validation**: Double-checks before any spending
- **Commission Calculation**: Server-side calculation prevents manipulation

## Future Enhancements

### Payment Integration
- World App payment flow for marks purchase
- Automated WLD to marks conversion
- Withdrawal functionality for unused marks

### Advanced Features
- Marks leaderboards and statistics
- Bulk boost options for power users
- Dynamic commission rates based on market conditions

### Analytics
- Boost effectiveness tracking
- Revenue analytics dashboard
- User behavior insights
