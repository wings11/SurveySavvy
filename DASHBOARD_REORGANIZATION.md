# Dashboard Reorganization & Marks Purchase Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Page Structure Reorganization

#### Created Profile Page (`/profile`)
- **Location**: `app/profile/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Dedicated user profile and account management
- **Components Included**:
  - User Profile card with stats and rank info
  - Activity Overview with survey metrics
  - Points Purchase management
  - Marks Manager for purchasing premium currency
  - Account Settings section with placeholders

#### Simplified Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)
- **Purpose**: Focused on survey creation and activity
- **Components Included**:
  - Create Survey form
  - Recent Surveys feed (SurveyFeed component)
  - Development tools (for testing)
- **Removed**: User profile, currency management (moved to Profile)

### 2. Navigation Updates

#### Added Profile Link
- Updated `components/Navigation/index.tsx`
- Added Profile menu item with user icon
- Navigation now includes: Surveys | Ranks | Dashboard | Profile

### 3. Marks Purchase Functionality

#### Created Purchase API Endpoint
- **Location**: `app/api/marks/purchase/route.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Validates WLD amount (0.1-50 WLD limit)
  - Converts WLD to marks using exchange rate
  - Validates user marks limits (max 5000)
  - Updates user balance atomically
  - Records transaction in mark_transactions table
  - Returns new balance to frontend

#### Enhanced MarksManager Component
- **Real Purchase Integration**: Calls actual API instead of placeholder
- **Current Balance Display**: Shows user's current marks with loading state
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for failed purchases
- **Balance Refresh**: Updates balance without page reload
- **Exchange Rate Info**: Clear display of conversion rates and limits

### 4. User Experience Improvements

#### Profile Page Layout
- **Two-column responsive design**
- **Left Column**: Profile card + Activity stats
- **Right Column**: Currency management + Account settings
- **Mobile-friendly**: Stacks vertically on small screens

#### Dashboard Simplification

- **Better Testing**: Isolated functionality easier to test

## Usage Flow

### For Users:
1. **Profile Page**: Check balance, purchase marks, manage account
2. **Dashboard Page**: Create surveys with optional marks boost
3. **Survey Feed**: Help surveys and earn both points and marks
4. **Seamless Experience**: Balance updates reflect immediately

### For Administrators:
1. **Transaction Tracking**: Complete audit trail in database

3. **Withdrawal System**: Allow users to convert marks back to WLD
4. **Advanced Analytics**: User behavior and revenue dashboards
5. **Settings Functionality**: Actually implement nickname changes, privacy settings

The reorganization creates a much cleaner, more intuitive user experience while fully implementing the marks purchase system with proper backend integration.
