# Survey Help Features Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implemented features for the survey help system with World ID verification.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Prevent Users from Helping Their Own Surveys
- **Frontend**: SurveyFeed component now fetches current user data and compares with survey owner
- **Backend**: Server-side validation in `/api/surveys/[id]/verify` prevents self-help
- **UI**: Own surveys are clearly marked with "(Your Survey)" label and disabled help button
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages when users attempt to help their own surveys

### 2. World ID Verification Integration
- **Action Identifier**: `"surveyformverification"` as specified
- **Verification Level**: Orb level verification required
- **Signal**: Survey ID is passed as the signal for verification
- **Integration**: Uses MiniKit SDK for seamless World App verification
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for verification failures

### 3. Rank System Consistency
- **Unified Ranks**: Synchronized frontend and backend rank systems
- **Current Ranks**:
  - Level 1: Curious Novice (0+ points)
  - Level 2: Inquisitive Apprentice (120+ points)
  - Level 3: Data Disciple (360+ points)
  - Level 4: Survey Scholar (800+ points)
  - Level 5: Methodologist (1600+ points)
  - Level 6: Analytic Fellow (2800+ points)
  - Level 7: Academic Luminary (4500+ points)
  - Level 8: Arch Chancellor of Inquiry (15000+ points)
- **Dynamic Updates**: Ranks update in real-time based on points earned

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states during verification process
- **Clear Labels**: Own surveys are clearly marked
- **Point Notifications**: Users see points earned after successful help
- **Rank Progress**: Visual progress bars toward next rank
- **Auto Refresh**: Survey list and user data refresh after successful verification

## API Changes

### `/api/surveys` (GET)
- **Added**: `owner_user_id` field to identify survey owners
- **Purpose**: Enable frontend to prevent self-help attempts

### `/api/surveys/[id]/verify` (POST)
- **Updated**: Action identifier to `"surveyformverification"`
- **Enhanced**: Better error messages for different failure scenarios
- **Validation**: Server-side prevention of self-help

### `/api/users/me` (GET)
- **Enhanced**: Consistent rank calculation using unified system
- **Auto-update**: Ranks are automatically updated when points change

## Technical Implementation

### SurveyFeed Component
```typescript
// Key features:
- World ID verification with MiniKit SDK
- Owner detection and prevention
- Real-time loading states
- Comprehensive error handling
- Auto-refresh after successful verification
```

### Verification Flow
1. User clicks "Help Survey"
2. System checks if user owns the survey
3. If not owner, initiates World ID verification
4. MiniKit SDK handles World App communication
5. Backend verifies proof and awards points
6. Frontend updates with success/failure feedback
7. Survey list and user profile refresh automatically

### Security Features
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Server prevents multiple helps from same user
- **World ID Verification**: Ensures human verification for each help
- **Owner Protection**: Multiple layers preventing self-help
- **Daily Limits**: Point earning limits to prevent abuse

## User Interface Improvements
- Clear visual distinction for own surveys
- Loading spinners during verification
- Disabled states for unavailable actions
- Success/error notifications with detailed feedback
- Real-time rank and progress updates

## Error Handling
- **Network Errors**: Graceful handling of connection issues
- **Verification Failures**: Clear messaging for World ID issues
- **Duplicate Attempts**: Friendly notification for already helped surveys
- **Permission Errors**: Clear explanation for self-help prevention
- **Daily Limits**: Notification when daily point limit reached

## Configuration
- **Action ID**: `"surveyformverification"`
- **Verification Level**: Orb
- **Daily Point Cap**: 500 points (configurable via environment)
- **Point Range**: 5-18 points per survey based on goal count
